Q6 You are given a directory containing different types of files (only files
no directories). These files have an extension in their name. For example,
cs205.txt is of .txt extension. Write a script that creates one
directory for each file. This directory should be of the same name as
 of the file but without the extension. After creating this directory the
script should also move (not copy) the file in the corresonding directory.
 [Note: Look at the sed and awk commands]
