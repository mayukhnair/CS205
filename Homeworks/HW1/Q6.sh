# You are given a directory containing different types of files (only files
# no directories). These files have an extension in their name. For example,
# cs205.txt is of .txt extension. Write a script that creates one
# directory for each file. This directory should be of the same name as
# of the file but without the extension. After creating this directory the
# script should also move (not copy) the file in the corresonding directory.
